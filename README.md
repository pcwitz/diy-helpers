We all know "two is better than one" and "the more the merrier." This is especially true when it comes to home improvement projects. How about an application (tool) that pairs neighborhood talent with neighborhood talent and brings encouragement and expertise to your own home improvement projects? A barter system for DIY-ers (Do It Yourselfers).

The truth is that a fellow or gal may like to get out of the house and help another if he or she has a project that he or she needs an extra hand with...I believe the term is reciprocity. There are also plenty of folks out there that want to learn some home improvement techniques, i.e., dry walling, putting up ceiling fans, changing bathtub faucets, replacement windows, etc. and watching another do it with the intention of helping out (to the best of one's ability) is an excellent opportunity for learning. I've known a few plumbers-by-night or electricians-by-night that have a day job at the office, but nevertheless enjoy getting down to the nitty gritty when need be rather than calling a "professional" for help. Usually calling the "expert" is outrageously expensive, and, coupled with the knowledge that it ain't brain surgery, many look for an alternative. There is a lot to learn when it comes to keeping up the house, especially in my neighborhood where the median age of a home is 90 years old.

## Users and Audience

- DIY studs

## Features

- Registration (in 3 Parts). Firstly, we ask for basic contact information: name, email, etc., yet we also ask for home address; and you will see in Feature #3 why this is necessary. Secondly, we determine the homeowner's skill level with a short assessment of home projects based on previous exposure. Lastly, we give each homeowner the option of contributing tools to the DIY Helpers Toolshed to be shared among members.
- Project Board. This is an interface that facilitates the posting of neighborhood projects and various details that may interest someone in helping out. The homeowner posts a description of a project, any special skills or trades that would be beneficial to the project, and finally, requests any tools currently available in the DIY Helpers Toolshed that would be of use to the project.  In addition, when a new project is posted, DIY Helpers members that have skills well-suited to the new project are sent an email notification.
- Project Tracking.  Once a home improvement project is posted, the Project Page gives a summary of progress by allowing the project owner (as well as anyone from the DIY Helpers community who has joined the project) to post updates on the project. When a DIY Helper decides to join a neighbor's project, the owner of the project is sent an email notification. The Project Summary will list all DIY Helpers, trades, and tools involved with the project, as well as start and finish dates.
- The Toolshed. This is a virtual storage shed where homeowners have the option to offer up their own tools to be shared by other members, if requested. The owner has the option to lend or deny, and indeed, whether to participate at all. The borrowing and lending workflow consists of a request by a potential borrower, the response of the tool owner; and, if the owner chooses to lend the tool, a final step where the owner confirms the tool has been returned. Only at the point where the tool is in the owner's possession should the return of the tool be confirmed. At that point the tool is returned to the virtual shed and once again made available for use by another project. It may take some folks a little getting used to borrowing one's <i>own</i> tool from the DIY Helpers Toolshed. Keep in mind that the tools in the toolshed are shared by all and if you need your tool for your own project, you will need to check it out to your own project so it is not available for others.
